CSE 445 Assignment 4 starter pack
=================================
Files in this zip:
- submission.cs        -> the ONLY file you submit to Gradescope
- Hotels.xml           -> valid sample XML with 10 hotels
- HotelsErrors.xml     -> XML with 5 injected errors
- Hotels.xsd           -> schema for Hotels.xml

Quick steps:
1. Create a public GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (root).
2. Upload Hotels.xml, HotelsErrors.xml, Hotels.xsd to the repo root.
3. Copy the GitHub Pages URLs and paste them into submission.cs (the three static strings).
4. Build and run submission.cs locally to confirm:
     - first line: "No errors are found"
     - second line: list of validation errors
     - third block: JSON text
5. Submit ONLY submission.cs to Gradescope.
